# UFOs
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to build a table with created filters, to make the table fully dynamic, 
from UFO sighting data stored in a JavaScript array. The table was placed into an HTML file for easy viewing. 
The challenge specifically focused on providing a more in-depth analysis of the UFO sightings by allowing users
to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. The code was refactored and the HTML file was adjusted to 
accommodate for the additional filters.
## Results
Using the filters on the webpage is very simple and the filter functions will automatically begin filtering the
data once information is entered into the boxes. A visual walkthrough is provided below starting with the 
unfiltered webpage.
